ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection Using CNN:

This project focuses on detecting and classifying plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on images of healthy and diseased plants, enabling automated identification to assist farmers and researchers in early disease detection.

ðŸ”¹ Features:-

Image Classification: Identifies different plant diseases from input images.
Deep Learning Approach: Uses a CNN model trained on a dataset of plant leaf images.
GUI for User Interaction: A simple graphical interface to upload and analyze images.
Accuracy & Performance Metrics: Displays model performance with accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib,Flask GUI: Streamlit
